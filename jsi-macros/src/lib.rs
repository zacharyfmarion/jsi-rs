/// - Add `#[host_object(getter)]` to designate an `fn` as a getter. This will
///   allow JavaScript code to read the member like a property instead of having
///   to call it like a function. Getters should be `fn(&self, &mut
///   RuntimeHandle) -> Result<T>` where `T: IntoValue`.
/// 
///   If the `fn` name in Rust starts with `get_`, this prefix will be removed.
///   
/// - Add `#[host_object(setter)]` to designate an `fn` as a setter. This will
///   allow JavaScript code to write the like a property instead of having to
///   call it like a function. Setters should be `fn(&self, &mut RuntimeHandle,
///   value: JsiValue) -> Result<()>`.
/// 
///   If the `fn` name in Rust starts with `set_`, this prefix will be removed.

/// - All other methods will appear as methods on the host object in JavaScript.
///   The first two arguments should be `&self` and a `&mut Runtime`.
/// 
/// By default, all member names in a `host_object` block are converted from
/// `snake_case` to `camelCase` to give them idiomatic names in JavaScript. To
/// override this, you can set a name with `#[host_object(method as
/// custom_method_name)]` or `#[host_object(getter as custom_prop_name)]`.
